    "### Introduction\n",
    "Imagine you work for a social media company named ‘Chirper.’ On this social media platform users have profiles and publish relatively short text messages for other users to read, like, and/or dislike; these messages are referred to as *chirps*. You are tasked with implementing functions which parse and manipulate the data of this social network platform. A description regarding the intended behaviour of these functions follows.<br>\n",
    "Note: One potential difficulty of this assignment is to realize how the data is stored and what it represents. Pay close attention to the input and returns types of each function. "

    "To give you a better idea to how the social platform works, here are some summary points and definitions: \n",
    "1. A *chirp* is string (like a message). A chirp may also have *tags* associated with it which users can add. These tags have %’s in front of them, do not include white space or other %’s in them. <br>For example, a chirp may be: `Nothing on the midterm was taught in lecture! %CS1MD3 %Unfair %ShouldHaveGoneToWestern` <br>Valid tags are: `%2EZ`, `%my cute cat`, `%EarnDat$$`, etc. <br>Invalid tags are: `%my cute cat`, `%The99%`, `my tag`, etc. \n",
    "2. Each Chirper user has a set of profiles they follow, and a set of profiles which follow them. If User 1 follows User 2, it does not necessarily mean User 2 follows User 1. \n",
    "3. A `profiles_dictionary` is of the type `Dict[int, Tuple[str, List[int], List[int]]]`; `profiles_dictionary` is used as a shorthand for this type in the function descriptions later in this document. The keys of a `profiles_dictionary` are unique integers representing user id numbers. The `profiles_dictionary` values contain the profile information corresponding to the specific user id number given as the key. The values are Tuples, where the *first element* of the list is the corresponding *user name*, the *second element* is a list of user ids representing the user’s *followers* (the user id given as the key), and the *third element* is a list of user ids that the user in question is *following*. \n",
    "4. A `chirp_dictionary` is of the type `Dict[int, Tuple[int, str, List[str], List[int], List[int]]]`; `chirp_dictionary` is used as a shorthand for this type in the function descriptions later in this document. The keys of a `chirp_dictionary` are unique integers representing chirp id numbers. The `chirp_dictionary` values contain the chirp information corresponding to the specific chirp id number given as the key. The values are Tuples. The *first element* of the list is the *user id chirp’s author*. The *second element* is the *chirp* itself. The *third element* is a list of *tags* associated with the chirp. The *fourth element* is a list of user ids which *liked* the chirp. And the *fifth element* is a list of user ids which *disliked* the chirp."

    "`create_chirp_dictionary(file_name)` opens the file `file_name` in the current working directory and reads the content into a `chirp dictionary`.<br>\n",
    "The input parameter is the name of a text file containing all of Chirper’s message information. You may assume the file is in the same directory as this notebook. The file is a series of message data, where data for each message has the following format:<br>\n",
    "`CHIRPID`<br>\n",
    "`USERID`<br>\n",
    "`MESSAGE`<br>\n",
    "`TAG1, TAG2, ..., TAGk`<br>\n",
    "`LIKED1, LIKED2, ..., LIKEDn`<br>\n",
    "`DISLIKED1, DISLIKED2, ..., DISLIKEDm`<br>\n",
    "where `CHIRPID`, `USERID`, `LIKEDi`, and `DISLIKEDj` are all unique numbers. `USERID` is the id of the user which made the chirp. The *third line* is the *chirp* itself. The *fourth line* represents a list of *tags* associated with said chirp. The *fifth line* is a sequence of user ids which *liked* the chirp. The *sixth line* is a sequence of user ids which *disliked* the chirp. In the text file there is always a blank-line between different chirps. Based off this data, the function constructs a `profiles_dictionary` where the orders of the tags and ids representing likes and dislikes, are in the same orders in which they appear in the text file. If there are no tags associated with a chirp, the empty string is associated with it instead. See `chirps.txt`, which is included in the same directory as this notebook, as an example. Once again, you may assume that the given text file is perfect and that there are no formatting errors."
